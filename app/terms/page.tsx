        <LegalSection title="Agreement to Terms">
          <p>
            These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Domz (the “Platform”),
            operated by Domz.com LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
            State of New Jersey (“Domz,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By accessing or using the Platform,
            you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not access or use the Platform.
          </p>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Nature of the Platform">
          <p>
            Domz is a directory and communication platform that enables domain name buyers and sellers
            to discover listings and communicate directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Domz does not act as a broker, escrow agent, marketplace, or intermediary. Domz does not
            participate in negotiations, process payments, hold funds, facilitate or execute domain
            transfers, provide legal, financial, or transactional advice, or verify ownership, authority,
            or intent of any user.
          </p>
          <p>
            All transactions, negotiations, payments, transfers, and agreements occur entirely outside
            the Platform and are the sole responsibility of the participating users.
          </p>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Eligibility and Accounts">
          <p>
            You must be at least 18 years old and legally capable of entering binding agreements to use
            the Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials, all
            activity conducted through your account, and ensuring that all information you provide is
            accurate and current.
          </p>
          <p>
            Domz reserves the right to refuse service, suspend, restrict, or terminate access to the
            Platform at any time, for any reason, with or without notice, in its sole discretion.
          </p>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Listings and User Content">
          <p>
            By submitting a listing or other content, you represent and warrant that you have the legal
            right and authority to list the domain, that the domain is not stolen, disputed, or unlawfully
            controlled, and that the linked landing page accurately represents the domain’s availability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Listings must link directly to a domain-specific landing page and must clearly indicate that
            the domain is for sale, such as Buy Now, Make Offer, or Request Price.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are responsible for promptly updating or removing listings if a domain is sold or no
            longer available.
          </p>
          <p>
            Domz reserves the right to review, remove, or delist any content at its discretion, without
            obligation to provide notice or explanation.
          </p>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="No Transaction Involvement">
          <p>
            Domz does not participate in or oversee any transaction, including price determination,
            negotiations, selection of escrow or payment methods, payment processing, domain transfers,
            or dispute resolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are solely responsible for conducting due diligence and determining whether and how
            to complete any transaction.

        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Prohibited Conduct">

            activity; impersonate another individual or entity; list domain names you do not own or
            control; introduce malware, scripts, or harmful code; scrape, harvest, or collect data from
            the Platform for competitive or commercial use without authorization; or circumvent, disable,
            or interfere with Platform security or functionality.
          </p>
          <p>

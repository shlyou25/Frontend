                Built to help you sell more and keep more, Domz puts profit back in your pocket. Most marketplaces take a commission on every sale—so the more you earn, the more you lose. Domz takes a different approach. We use a simple, fixed subscription fee, so you keep 100% of every deal. No percentage cuts. No hidden charges. Just predictable costs and maximum return.
